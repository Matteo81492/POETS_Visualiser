As part of my MSc project, I'm developing a visualisation tool that takes in the [POETS](https://poets-project.org/about) instrumentation data and outputs a graphical representation of the hardware utilisation. To do so, I'll develop the backend in Python using the Bokeh library, and I'll also write HTML code to design a web page where the graphs can be displayed. The following is a screenshot showing the dashboard during the initial phases of an application:
